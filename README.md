This is a website (simple widget) that shows abeta and G5 interaction from this article - 
Heller, G. T. et al. Small-molecule sequestration of amyloid-β as a drug discovery strategy for Alzheimer’s disease. Science Advances 6, eabb5924 (2020).

Includes the original trajecotry (protein-ligand), plus the darker regions illustrated as VDW as predicted most-likely binding spots in real-time. 
Each frame is re-caclauted, such that the predicted ligand movement is updated at each ts.
