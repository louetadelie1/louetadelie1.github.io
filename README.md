This is a website (simple widget) that shows abeta and G5 interaction from this article - Small-molecule sequestration of amyloid- as a drug discovery strategy for Alzheimer’s disease.

Includes the original trajecotry (protein-ligand), plus the darker regions illustrated as VDW as predicted most-likely binding spots in real-time. 
Each frame is re-caclauted, such that the predicted ligand movement is updated at each ts.
